 This report shows revenue generated from customers that ordered more than once in descending order.
 these are customer that made multiple order occasionally or customer who ordered multiple item at thesame time. additionally, from the report it is understandable     that the customer ID (14646) who ordered the most, did not generate the highest revenue. This may be as a result of discount or there is promotions in some product     the customer ordered and these could reduce the revenue the customer would have generated for the company. In summary, it is not guaranteed that the customer who order the most will generate the highest revenue for the company because the prices, discounts and promotions can vary and affect the actual revenue generated per order.
 
 
 ### Customers that repeated the most in descending order:

## General Report And Recommendation.

### The reason the company might have made highest sales in the month of November:

November is one of the key months for companies to make sales. November is the start of Christmas holiday shopping season. So, many customers are seeking for discount, deals on goods and services in the month of November. Companies always capitalize on this by giving promotions and discount. 
Additionally, some workers receive their Christmas holiday bonuses or government tax refunds in month of November, giving them more money to spend on goods and services. Another factor which could influence companies’ sales in the month of November are Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Thanksgiving. These factors are great opportunities for companies to make sales and generate revenue.

### The reason the company might have made lowest sales in the month of February:

February is typically a slower sales month for many companies. With the holiday season over, shoppers no longer have the same urgency to purchase, leading to lower demand for products and services. Furthermore, the company may have sold out of certain items or exhausted their promotional discounts, further decreasing the likelihood of customers making a purchase.

### How the company can increase sales in the month of February:

The company need to implement some strategies like “giving new promotional or discounts offers, releasing new products, and increasing their online presence if they want to increase their sales in the month of February”. The company could also engage in market targeting advertisement. if the company utilise these factors, it can help the company to make sales and generate revenue during the slow period.
